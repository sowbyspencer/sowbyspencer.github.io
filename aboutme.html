        <h2>Spencer Sowby</h2>
        <h2>'Sowby'</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Spencer Sowby. I am 26 years old and second oldest of eight kids. My nickname Sowby has come from a few of my friends in Jr. High and high school who first identified because both my parents were their teachers before they had met me.</p>
        <p>I currently have an I.T. job for a school district, but I am continuing education in slightly different direction, software development. I've gone to a tech college and Weber State. I've already received a certificate and an associate degree. I plan to earn a bachelors in applied technology here at BYUI.</p>
        <p>In my spare time I like to do nothing particularly important. Now that I'm going to school again it seems that I'll have much less spare time. I am not married, but I do enjoy watching my nieces and nephews. Each Sunday I visit my parents and my brother's family. Even though I don't live with them. We are still very much a family.</p>
        <p>I have yet to discover the exact "Why ?" of going back to school. But I hope to find out as I grow along the way.</p>
